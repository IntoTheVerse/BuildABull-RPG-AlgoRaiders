### built by team IntoTheVerse 
- (@memxor) and (@lopeselio) on ALgorand Discord

### Features developed during the hackathon
Features worked on during the hackathon âœ…(achieved)/ðŸ”„(undergoing):
- On-chain Player Profile creation and game leaderboards âœ…
- In-game loot collection in the form of Algorand Digital Asset Standard $DUN (Dungeon Token) to your wallet âœ…
- In-game marketplace to buy your favourite raiders and customise weapons on-chain (Algorand Digital Asset Standard) using $DUN âœ…
- Reversible permadeath - death is fatal but can be reversed on-chain using potions (using freeze authority on Algorand)ðŸ”„
- VRFs implementation within the Unity SDK - VRFs help to randomise the rewards in the form of lootboxes, and get randomised game attributes determined by cryptographic functions ðŸ”„

### Solution
**Real Ownership - more than just having an NFT in your wallet**
- Upgradability of Assets on-chain 
- Asset Portability - You can take your game assets wherever you go
- Interoperability - Allow gamers to use their assets across multiple experiences while ensuring technical safeguards
- Improved Gaming Experience
- Friendly UX and on-chain without compromising game design (Web2 Speeds)

### Challenges faced and Takeaways 

#### Challenges:
- Purestake APIs had sunsetted, needed an alternative
- We were taking a server based approach (client <-> NodeJS Server <-> Algorand Server) and c# SDK for WalletConnect. After exploring Unity SDK by algorand, we now have a standalone client directly interfacong with smart contracts using the SDK without a server
- Wallet connect V2 was not working so we had issues with making the mobile app of the game
- We were trying to create a native implementation of VRF by Algorand within the SDK, to generate random number cryptographically, but couldn't achieve it within the time frame. 

#### Takeaways:
âœ… First Hands-on Algorand Standard Assets and token model
âœ… Understanding Algorand Unity SDK, algodAPI, indexer, algonode APIs since purestake APIs were shutdown
âœ… Data indexers using GraphQL using C# library
âœ… NFT Storefront that uses $DUN Token for purchases and also reflecting the same inside the Unity client using the SDK, without any server
